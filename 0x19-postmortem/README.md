# Service Outage and Slow Response Time - README

This README provides an overview of the service outage and slow response time incident that occurred on June 10, 2023, affecting the Customer Dashboard. It includes information about the duration, impact, root cause, resolution, and corrective/preventative measures taken to address the issue.

## Issue Summary

**Duration**: June 10, 2023, 3:00 PM to June 11, 2023, 10:00 AM (PST)  
**Impact**: Slow response time and intermittent service disruptions  
**Affected Service**: Customer Dashboard  
**User Experience**: Users experienced delays in accessing the Customer Dashboard, with page loading times ranging from 30 seconds to several minutes. Approximately 70% of users were affected during peak hours.

## Root Cause

The root cause of the service outage and slow response time was an overloaded database server, which struggled to handle the increased user traffic and inefficient queries.

## Timeline

- **June 10, 2023, 3:30 PM (PST)**: Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating high database server load.
- Investigation started by the operations team, focusing on the database server and backend services.
- Initial assumption: A spike in incoming traffic might have caused the database server to reach its capacity limits.
- Misleading investigation/debugging paths included suspicions of a DDoS attack and analysis of backend services, which didn't reveal significant problems.
- Escalation to the database administration team and senior engineers from the backend services team for additional expertise and support.
- **June 11, 2023, 10:00 AM (PST)**: Incident resolved after implementing optimization measures on database queries, introducing indexing improvements, query caching mechanisms, and adding more database servers.

## Resolution

To address the issue, the following actions were taken:
- Optimization of database queries and introduction of indexing improvements.
- Implementation of query caching mechanisms to reduce database load.
- Addition of more database servers to distribute the load effectively.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures were identified:
1. Implement proactive monitoring and alerting system to detect abnormal database server load and query performance.
2. Conduct regular code and query performance reviews to identify optimization opportunities.
3. Enhance load testing processes to simulate high traffic scenarios and ensure system scalability.
4. Improve database server capacity planning to accommodate future traffic growth.
5. Enhance collaboration between teams to facilitate efficient incident response and troubleshooting.

## Tasks to Address the Issue

The following tasks were identified to address the issue and implement the corrective and preventative measures:
1. Optimize database queries and introduce proper indexing based on performance analysis.
2. Implement query caching mechanisms to reduce database load.
3. Add additional database servers to distribute the load effectively.
4. Enhance monitoring system to provide early detection of similar performance issues.
5. Conduct load testing regularly to validate system scalability.

## Conclusion

The service outage and slow response time incident highlighted the importance of proactive monitoring, performance optimization, and collaboration between teams. By addressing the root cause, optimizing queries, implementing caching mechanisms, and adding resources, the issue was resolved. The identified measures and tasks will help prevent similar incidents and improve the overall reliability and scalability of the system.
